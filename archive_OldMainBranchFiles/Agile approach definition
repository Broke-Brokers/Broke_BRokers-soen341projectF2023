Agile is a fluid and iterative method of managing projects and creating software. 
Throughout the course of the project, it places a focus on teamwork, customer input, and the capacity to adjust to changing requirements. 

Agile divides the project into smaller segments known as "iterations" or "sprints" as opposed to a strict, linear plan. In these iterations, teams focus on smaller areas of the project, which makes it simpler to adjust to shifting priorities or client demands. 

One of the most widely used Agile approaches is scrum. 
It offers teams a well-organized framework for working within the Agile principles. 
A project is broken into time-boxed iterations known as "sprints," which typically run 2-4 weeks. 
The Product Owner, who is in charge of outlining and prioritizing requirements, the Scrum Master, who oversees the Scrum process, and the Development Team, who is in charge of creating the product, are the three main positions in Scrum.  

Agile/Scrum is well-suited for real estate web applications due to the industry's changing nature, complex requirements, and the need for collaboration and user feedback. Consider adopting Agile/Scrum practices to increase the likelihood of project success.
