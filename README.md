### 2023-09-29

We learned that our repository was not correctly set up on 2023-09-28
* We have created an organization : https://github.com/Broke-Brokers
* And a team : https://github.com/orgs/Broke-Brokers/teams/broke-brokers
* And cloned our old repository here.

It also came to our attention from the prof's updates on the sprint #2 planning presented in class yesterday that we did not introduce the backlog and sprints backlog in the correct manner. We did not know we could use the "project"  and "issue" tab to do this. 

We will transfer all the information from external files and internal .md files and wiki to the project tab and create issues from the tasks for sprint #2. 

_For sprint #1 the files can be found here_:

* [Project backlog](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/wiki/Project-Backlog#broke-brokers-project-backlog)
* [sprint #1 backlog](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/wiki/Project-Backlog#sprint-1)
* [sprint #1 task breakdown](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/blob/main/Sprint%20%231/Sprint1_TaskBreakdown.md)
* [sprint #2 backlog](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/blob/main/Sprint%20%232/Sprint2_Backlog.md)
* [sprint #2 task breakdown](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/blob/main/Sprint%20%232/Sprint%202Task_%20Breakdown.xlsx)
* [descriptive plan for sprint #2](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/soen341_fproject2023/wiki#plan-for-sprint-2)

## 1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
This project uses Agile Scrum principles and consists of creating a real estate web application 
to serve homebuyers, property renters, brokers, and administrators. 
The project duration is 12 weeks and comprises 4 incremental sprints. 
The web application allows users to search for properties, save favourites, 
request property visits, and perform CRUD operations (Create, read, update, delete) on property listings. 
Brokers can submit offers, manage property listings, match properties with buyers, and oversee visits.

# Getting Started with Create React App

- 1- npm install react-scripts --save
- 2- npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## install additional components

### react image gallery 

- npm install react-image-gallery
### MUI component library : 

- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
- npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
form : https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/
### font awesome 

- npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
- npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
- npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

### react range selector  :
npm install react-range

### emailJs
npm install @emailjs/browser --save

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
