Task breakdown was transferred from tables and documents to organization project and separated in issues in the repo.

[Task breakdown : User stories Homebuyer, Renter and Broker have been broken down into components. ](https://github.com/Broke-Brokers/Broke_BRokers-soen341projectF2023/issues/24#issuecomment-1745741698)
Added references to other issues in the components. But I did not create more issues.

Ask team to familiarize themselves and update the tasks on where they are at , assign themselves. When overtaking a component , we should copy/paste the breakdown and create new issues referenced in the user story issue.

I have assigned milestones and sprints to the tasks

Changes on the GitHub
