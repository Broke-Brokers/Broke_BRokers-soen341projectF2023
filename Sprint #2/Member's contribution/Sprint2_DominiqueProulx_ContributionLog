Task breakdown was transferred from tables and documents to organization project and separated in issues in the repo.

User stories Homebuyer, Renter and Broker have been broken down into components.
tags such as [BUTTON] and [FORM] were used to identify the type of component  needed from user stories.
Added references to other issues in the components. But I did not create more issues.

Ask team to familiarize themselves and update the tasks on where they are at , assign themselves.
When overtaking the creation of a componen, we should copy/paste the breakdown and create new issues referenced in the user story issue.

I have assigned milestones and sprints to the issues.
